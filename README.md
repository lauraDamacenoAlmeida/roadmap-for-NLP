<a name="what"></a>
## :computer: 1. What is NLP?

According to IBM, Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with **giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can**. 

NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.


<a name="why"></a>
## :woman_technologist: 2. Why NLP? What is the benefits?

1. Perform large-scale analysis:
2. Get a more objective and accurate analysis: 
3. Improve customer satisfaction: 
4. Better understand your market:
5. Get actionable insights:

<a name="programming"></a>
## :keyboard: 5. Best programming Language for NLP

1. **Python:** Python is very popular in this field because of its versatility. And it offers developers a lot of libraries which handle many NLP-related tasks like topic modeling, document classification, sentiment analysis etc.
2. **Java:** Java is another commonly used programming language in the field of natural language processing. With the help of this language, you can explore how to organize text utilizing full-text search, information extraction, clustering, and tagging. You can use this libs: OpenNLP, LingPipe and Stanford CoreNLP
3. **R:** While R is popular for being used in statistical learning, it’s widely used for natural language processing.

*I recommend you start with python because there’re lots of things that make Python the best programming language for a natural language processing project*

Popular libraries in python for you learn:
* NLTK
* spaCy
* Core NLP
* Text Blob
* PyNLPI
* Gensim
* Pattern
